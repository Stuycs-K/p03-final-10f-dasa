# Final Project Proposal

## Group Members:

Amrit Das

# Intentions:

I would like to further develop the music library we developed in class to actually run multiple songs.
Currently, I'm planning on doing multiple libraries while implementing either a server or multiple processes(pipes) that can load multiple songs and play each one depending on certain commands. Intend to use mpg123 program to play some music!

# Intended usage:

The idea of a music library would be similar. I'm planning to have the user be able to "load" songs onto a single client. However, users can access more than one client so they can load songs multiple times. They will be able to run things like keyboard commands and, ideally, switch the song that is playing to one loaded in the next server.

# Technical Details:

Class Topics(subject to modification): working with files, allocating memory, finding info about files, shared memory, pipes/sockets.

I'm responsible for everything so yeah... 

I plan to start by re-visting the lab where we worked on the music library and looking at the basic structure plus where it would be best to add modifications. I will then look at the server and forking pipe labs in order to gain inspiration for what each server/client interface will look like. Lastly, work with the mpg123 interface to actually load and modify songs.

# Intended pacing:

TBD. Have to go home today and check schedule for accurate pacing.
