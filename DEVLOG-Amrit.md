## Amrit Das.

### 2026-01-06 - Brief description
* Finding a group...eventually decided to go single
* Thought about idea and wrote proposal during class.
* Became more familiar w/ the mpg123 package and started fleshing out concepts more. Have to start coding.

### 2026-01-07 - Brief description
* Started looking at existing codebase from previous labs and resources to see how library/node can work and necessary edits
* Did this both in-class and for HW

### 2026-01-08- Brief description
* Started to modify both client and server to have an orderly way to access songs. Needs to be a sort of controlled/well-oriented thing.

### 2026-01-09- Brief description
* Heavy hardcoding of client and server to best align to the needs of this project. ClientLogic done first, followed by the Server/SubserverLogic(might be done over the weekend)
* Should be done with the server/client side of things. Now need to do some actual testing before moving to mpg123

### 2026-01-12- Brief description
* Debugging the server sending songs. I need to make sure, today or early tomorrow, that the songs are sending well. Need to focus on the debugging of the actual library/node things.
